# Preservation

Documentation in this section focuses **preservation**.

With multiple stakeholders, preservation of digital objects is a complex and ongoing process.  Digital objects are never "done" or "safe", but require sustained attention and migration.  Though infinitely more can be said about each, [this document](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20161218195039/http://www.dpworkshop.org/dpm-eng/terminology/strategies.html) has a nice, succint range of activities that stewards of digital objects must consider as preservation activities.

This section of the documentation contains models, workflows, and information about preservation planning for the digital collections.
