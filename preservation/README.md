# Preservation

Documentation in this section focuses on all things digital preservation.

With multiple stakeholders, preservation of digital objects is a complex and ongoing process.  Digital objects are never "done" or "safe", but require sustained attention and migration.  Though infinitely more can be said about each, [this document](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20161218195039/http://www.dpworkshop.org/dpm-eng/terminology/strategies.html) has a nice, succint range of activities that stewards of digital objects must consider as preservation activities.

This section of the documentation contains information and pointers to models, workflows, and preservation planning for the digital collections.

## Content Modeling

A reasonable place to start is [Content Modeling](../content_models).  Content modeling is central to digital preservation, as it underpins how digital objects in this particular repository are understood and shaped.
