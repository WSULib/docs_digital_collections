This area includes documentation for systems and software essential to the operation of the digital collections infrastructure.  This includes things like [Fedora Commons](fedora/), [Solr](solr/), our python middleware [Ouroboros](ouroboros/), [vagrant-based virtual machines](virtual_machines/) used for development and deployment, among others.

The focus is highly technical:
* how do things start / stop?
* how are they installed?
* troubleshooting
* how to think about them in operation?
