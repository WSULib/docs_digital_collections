This area includes documentation for systems and software essential to the operation of the digital collections infrastructure.  This includes things like Fedora Commons, Solr, our python middleware Ouroboros, and others.

The focus is highly technical:
* how do things start / stop?
* how are they installed?
* troubleshooting
* how to think about them in operation?
