## Deploying the Digital Collections

There are multiple considerations when deploying a version of the digital collections infrastructure. In addition to addressing adequate server space and security concerns, you will need to be comfortable with building development and production environments through automated script. The Digital Collections are built with a combination of Vagrant and VirtualBox when deploying a development environment and, for production, through an automated shell script.

### The specifics
See the [virtual machines section](virtual_machines/README.md) for more detail on the specifics of deployment in both production and development.
