### Why the :tomato:?
Sustainable documentation for digital infrastructure is often one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated steps in the process.  It began as shorthand for a `ToDo` list: tomatoes look somewhat like bullet points for a list, and they have the added attribute of, when rotten, being thrown at deserving parties.  It was felt this imagery was in-line with our desire to push ourselves to document more.  Write documentation, avoid a tomato.
